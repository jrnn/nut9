"""
The idea, roughly, is as follows:
- Lines can be expressed as binary strings (i.e. sequences of 1s and 0s).
- The next line is calculated by "sliding" a 5-bit buffer through a line and
  piecing together a new line bit by bit, according to the given rules.
- Since the buffer has 5 bits, it can exist in 2^5 = 32 different states, each
  of which corresponds either to a filled or blank square (1 or 0). Since this
  is determined by fixed rules, the stateâ€”result relations need to be calculated
  only once, and can then be accessed from memory.
- Nothing beyond a primitive integer and basic bitwise operations is needed to
  to handle the buffer.
- When calculating lines, two things are kept track of: (1) the patterns of
  filled and blank squares, and (2) their horizontal placement relative to the
  the first line ("offset").
- Each new line is stored in two sets: one which considers both the pattern and
  and its offset, and another which considers only the pattern. Checking the
  the membership of a new line in these sets is key in distinguishing "blinking"
  vs. "gliding" patterns.

    A pattern of filled and blank squares is expressed as a list of integers,
    indicating run lengths. For example, the sequence ##....#####...# translates
    to [ 2, 4, 5, 3, 1 ].

    Because blank squares on either end are meaningless, the first and last list
    entries always stand for filled squares. That is, runs of filled squares are
    found in even, and blank squares in odd indexes.

    In addition to the pattern itself, also its offset (distance of the leading
    filled square relative to the initial line) is memorized.
